Description: An implementation of a stochastic heuristic method for performing multidimensional function optimization. The method is inspired in the Cross-Entropy Method. It does not relies on derivatives, neither imposes particularly strong requirements into the function to be optimized. Additionally, it takes profit from multi-core processing to enable optimization of time-consuming functions.
